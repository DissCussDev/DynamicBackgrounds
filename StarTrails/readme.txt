Interactive Star Trails Background
This component listens for your mouse movements and generates a continuous stream of colorful "stars." These stars animate as if they are part of a flowing trail, and they are spawned in a way that avoids the immediate vicinity of your cursor, creating a beautiful and dynamic parting effect.


How It Works
React Component (StarTrails.js):

The component tracks the mouse's x and y coordinates using the useState and useEffect hooks. An event listener for mousemove is added when the component mounts and is cleaned up when it unmounts.

A second useEffect hook runs on a setInterval to continuously create new "star" elements. This effect depends on mousePos to ensure it always has the current cursor location.

The createStar function is the core of the logic. It dynamically creates a <div> element for each star.

Cursor Avoidance: A do-while loop generates random x and y coordinates for the new star. It calculates the distance between this point and the current mouse position. If the star is within the avoidanceRadius, it regenerates the coordinates until the star is a safe distance away.

Each star is given a random size and a vibrant color using hsl for a beautiful, varied look.

Finally, the star is appended directly to the document.body and a setTimeout is set to remove it after its animation has finished, preventing a build-up of DOM elements.

CSS (StarTrails.css):

The .star-trails-container sets up the dark space canvas, positioned behind all your other content.

The .star class has its pointer-events set to none which is crucial; it ensures the thousands of stars we create won't block clicks or hovers on the content above.

The fadeAndShrink animation creates the "trail" effect. Over two seconds, it scales the star down to nothingness and fades it out, giving the impression of a fleeting particle of light.

Simply place the <StarTrails /> component anywhere in your application layout, and your background will be transformed into an interactive cosmic field that responds to your every move. Enjoy orchestrating your own personal galaxy!
