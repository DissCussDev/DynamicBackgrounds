Floating Bubbles Background
This component creates a dreamy, interactive background where bubbles of various sizes and opacities drift upwards. When you click on a bubble, it will burst with a satisfying "pop" animation. It's all self-contained and ready to drop into your React application.


How It Works
React Component (FloatingBubbles.js):

The component uses React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of the bubbles.

On mount, it generates an initial set of bubbles and then uses setInterval to add new bubbles periodically, creating an endless stream.

Each bubble is given a random size, horizontal position, and animation duration, making the scene feel organic and natural.

The handleBubbleClick function adds a .pop class to the clicked bubble, triggering the pop animation, and then removes it from the state and the DOM.

CSS (FloatingBubbles.css):

The .bubble-container acts as our stage, positioned fixedly behind all other page content with a cool blue gradient.

The .bubble style creates the translucent, orb-like appearance.

The rise @keyframes animation handles the vertical ascent and adds a gentle side-to-side sway for a more realistic drift.

The pop-animation @keyframes provides that satisfying burst effect by scaling the bubble up and fading it out quickly.

Simply embed the <FloatingBubbles /> component in your app, and watch your background come to life with this playful and interactive design. I hope this brings a sense of joy and whimsy to your project!
